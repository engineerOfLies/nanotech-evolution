Since the focus of the game is the monster and raising it, the monster should be a relatively large sprite.  Smaller monsters should weigh in around 64 X 64 pixels, average sized monsters should be within 128X128 with larger monsters able to be up to 192 X 192.

monster styles:
Each of the monsters in the [initial] game will be based in one of these 5 major races (as the game grows I intend to add more).
  Lizard
  Bird
  Mammal
  Insect
  Plant

after the first evolution they will show signs of a growth style or aspect:
  Humanoid - grows to be bipedal, eventually looking more like an armored knight...
  Beast - Emphasizes the animal traits, eventually becoming massive and totally animal like
  Machine - Starts to become more machine than bio.  Final stages total mecha godzilla.
  Techno-organic - Fusion of bio and machine.  Early stages look like cyborgs, later stages are more clean.
  Spirit - Emphasizes special abilities.  Looking more like an sorcerer or angel/demon
  
The next stage will still show the growth aspect, but will show subtle elemental influences from the 5 basic elements in the game (palette swapping):
  Earth
  Water
  Air
  Fire
  Lightning

The final stages will differentiate to showcase the alignment of the monster:
  Holy - Angelic in appearance
  Dark - Demonic
  Normal - Meh

Backgrounds are intended to be 480 by 320 to allow for panning in combat.

Basic terrain types:
plains
fields
mountains
Volcanos
forrests
